>Namaste,
>Simon here, a German friend of Prem. He guided us some years ago in Nepal. And we had a very nice time together. 
>Now I want to come back with 2 friend to Nepal next year again. 
>We will arrive on 25.03.2023 (flights are booked) in Kathmandu and want to do the Manaslu Circuit. I was already having contact with Prem, if he could guide us on that track. He now said, that I should send you an email to get more informations from you about the track, price, preparation and other stuff. So that I am doing now. 
>So we would be very thankful to receive more informations from you. 
>We a looking forward to hear from you.
>All the best 
>Simon & Paul & Lukas

>Greetings from Ganesh trekking,
>
>We are very excited to hear that you are again coming to visit Nepal. I will send you the program this coming week. Before that, i would like to know something about you. Since you guys are three in number, which room do you prefer to stay in? Triple room or one double & one single? Standard room or deluxe room? How many total days do you want to stay in Nepal beside trekking(15days)? How many porters do u want to hire for trekking?
>
>After I get all other information, I will send you a price offer and your program here in Nepal.
>
>Hoping to get response from you soon. 
>
>Thanks and best regards,
>
>Sajan

>Hallo Sajan, 
>
>Thank you for the very fast respond. 
>So in the following I gonna answer you the questions. 
>For the rooms question we are very easy and flexible. So to say it in simple words: we don’t need single rooms and also no deluxe. So I’d say we would go for the most affordable/easy option in that case. Just let us know what makes the most sense out of your perspective. 
>
>So our plane is leaving again on 16.04.. If possible we would like to the the hike at the beginning to have at the end some days just to travel a little around. 
>
>We should be able to carry our backpacks (+some extra?) by our owns. Pending on the availability of food and water on the track I think we then do not need any additional porters. 
>
>Thanks!
>
>Looking forward to your respond.

>Dear Simon,
>
>Before I send you a program, I would like to know the exact time you are landing at Kathmandu airport.  Please would you mind sending me your flight details so that i can arrange one day or few hours for taking your permit for trekking? For that, I need an original passport for taking permit within office hour here in Nepal.

>Hello Sajan, 
>Thank you so much that you are responding so fast. Before we fix that program with you, I would like to have an overview about the tour and the cost for the guiding. I would like to discuss that together with my traveling partners. So I would really like to receive first of all deeper informations from you.
